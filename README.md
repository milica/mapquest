This is simple game that promotes different kind of amusement compared to other games.
Instead of sitting home for hours and playing on your computer or smartphone or whatever it is, you can go out and search
for places nearby and visit them.

By visiting those places you gain score, and besides that you also get to know more about
your neighborhood or learn about some places you've never been to and those are just step away.

in a way that people can really get to know a lot about their town and surroundings
by playing this game and visit places that otherwise they would never think of.
